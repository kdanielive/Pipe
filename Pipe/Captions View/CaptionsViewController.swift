        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
        Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
        And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
        And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
        And every fair from fair sometime declines,
        By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
        But thy eternal summer shall not fade
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
        Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
        When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
        So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
        So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
